### Video Facilitator (also called transcription checker)

**These facilitators are responsible for the post-call tasks. Please mark the tasks as completed when appropriate**

What you need to do: 

- [ ] Please ask the organising team for credentials to access [otter.ai](http://otter.ai/), YouTube and Zoom. We also share this information via Keybase (if you want you could create a Keybase account if you don’t have one already).
- [ ] You can publish the OLS video using your own account. Please create a YouTube account if you don’t have one and ask the Community Coordinator to give you editor access to the OLS YouTube account so you can publish the video. 
- [ ] Access OLS’ [Shared Drive](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lDLg0xztRfyEgdlJWFDHJMRW6c6k1Yyh02vux8HKDQA/edit#slide=id.g2127687abdb_2_2) to get the slide template for the video thumbnail that you can edit with the cohort call details. 
- [ ] When the video is published, please share it with the cohort directly via Slack.

#### Please try doing the video processing on the same week of the cohort call, so we can add the link to the recording to the weekly cohort mailing we send every Monday to all cohort members.

_Time commitment: 120-150 minutes per call_

Below we provide a summary checklist. For a detailed tutorial, please refer to [the detailed tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c92qDtKLvEM3stKWh0z0uIsqyyLWG37nnsgekbsiiKE/edit#heading=h.hfhzrjvnj7qh).

- [ ] 1. Download from Zoom cloud recordings
- [ ] 2. Upload to Otter.ai (_will need a few minutes to process_)
- [ ] 3. Upload to the OLS YouTube account
- [ ] 4. Create a front page slide for the video - templates are available in Google Drive
- [ ] 5. Make sure the YouTube video is added to the current cohort playlist
- [ ] 6. Correct Otter.ai transcripts (_make sure to use the uploaded video, not the original transcript, as the timings won't match the video_)
- [ ] 7. Download the corrected transcript as a .srt file from Otter
- [ ] 8. Upload it to the YouTube video
- [ ] 9. Post a link to the recording in the OLS Slack! 

#### After publishing the video, fill in the following information in our [OLS-8 planning sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tnk-kkHUmPOEfUOEAl627l6JS9SoY5D4gSAPCYoBRSY/edit#gid=2109933309) (the tab is “OLS-8”)

- [ ] Add link of YouTube video (column N)
- [ ] Also in column N, add the corresponding YouTube link at the exact time each individual talk starts. If you haven’t done this before, it is fairly easy. When you are on YouTube, click “share”, click the little box that says "start at" and the exact time you had chosen will show up, then click "copy" and paste such link in column N.
