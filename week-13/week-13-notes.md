## üñ• Talk: Personal Ecology and Self Care

[Irene] (35 min) [‚è∞ 40]

**Presenter**: Sara Villa

-   Contact / social:

**Notes**:

-   In order to lead people and communities it is key to be healthy ourselves
-   

**Question 1: WHAT ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT VALUES IN YOUR LIFE?**

-   Work, family and friends (it is time I also include others like physical self-care which I have been relegating for some time now)
-   Family, Intimate relationships, work, education, recreation
-   Parenthood, family, exercise and physical health
-   Family, friends, good work/life balance, mental and physical well-being, making a net positive change to the world
-   Be a good person, try to be kind with people, and take care of my family. Try to be well with myself, and with people who are near me
-   
-   
-   

**Question 2**: ACCORDING TO YOUR VALUES, **WHAT GOALS DO YOU WANT TO SET FOR THE NEAR FUTURE** (don't forget that they should follow SMART objectives!) and **COMMIT TO?**

-   

-   Actively scheduling time to catch up with friends and family regularly, figuring out how best to maintain work-life balance without burning out, scheduling a few mins/hours for relaxation and exercise

-   Take care of my phisical and mental health, go to gym where I can do Yoga. Have peace, be calm and helpful. Be conscius of the time for me and my family. Not all to work

-   Take 30min a week to myself to reflect on my current priorities and what I focus on for the week, e.g. work committments, life events, etc. (inc. saying no/deferring things if necessary).

-   mind and body and want to go to the swimming pool weekly.

-   I want to feel better in my body and mind and for this I commit to go swimming/yoga once a week (to start with!)

-   I want to dedicate more time to take care of my phisical health and my relationships
